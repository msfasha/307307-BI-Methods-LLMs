    "## **1. Introduction to Text Processing**  \n",
    "Text data is inherently **unstructured**, meaning that before we can use it in machine learning models, it must be **cleaned and structured**. NLP relies on **text preprocessing techniques** to convert raw text into a usable format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Proper text processing is crucial because:  \n",
    "âœ… Raw text often contains **noise** (punctuation, special characters, HTML tags).  \n",
    "âœ… Words may appear in **different forms** (\"running\" vs. \"ran\" vs. \"runs\").  \n",
    "âœ… **Common words** (like \"the\" and \"is\") may need to be removed to focus on meaningful words.  \n",
    "âœ… The model should be able to **understand text mathematically** (vectorization).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Preprocessing Steps:**  \n",
    "1. **Tokenization** â€“ Splitting text into words or sentences.  \n",
    "2. **Removing Stopwords** â€“ Filtering out common words that add little meaning.  \n",
    "3. **Stemming & Lemmatization** â€“ Reducing words to their base form.  \n",
    "4. **Text Normalization** â€“ Handling misspellings and different word forms.  \n",
    "5. **Vectorization** â€“ Converting text into numerical format (BoW, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Tokenization: Splitting Text into Units**  \n",
    "### **What is Tokenization?**  \n",
    "Tokenization is the process of **splitting text into smaller units** (tokens).  \n",
    "- **Word Tokenization:** Splits text into individual words.  \n",
    "- **Sentence Tokenization:** Splits text into full sentences.  \n",
    "- **Subword Tokenization:** Breaks words into meaningful sub-parts (used in deep learning).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Word Tokenization**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Natural Language Processing is powerful!\"\n",
    "tokens = word_tokenize(text)\n",
    "print(tokens)  # ['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'powerful', '!']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Sentence Tokenization**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Hello world. This is an NLP lecture.\"\n",
    "sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n",
    "print(sentences)  # ['Hello world.', 'This is an NLP lecture.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Relevance:**  \n",
    "âœ… **Chatbots**: Tokenization helps break down customer messages for better understanding.  \n",
    "âœ… **Search Engines**: Tokenization helps engines match user queries to relevant content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Removing Stopwords**  \n",
    "### **What are Stopwords?**  \n",
    "Stopwords are common words (such as **\"the\", \"is\", \"and\", \"in\"**) that do not add significant meaning to a sentence. Removing stopwords can improve NLP models by reducing noise and focusing on important words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Removing Stopwords**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n",
    "words = [\"this\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\", \"sentence\"]\n",
    "filtered_words = [w for w in words if w not in stop_words]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(filtered_words)  # ['example', 'sentence']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Relevance:**  \n",
    "âœ… **Sentiment Analysis**: Helps focus on keywords that influence sentiment.  \n",
    "âœ… **Resume Screening**: Removes common words, focusing on relevant skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Stemming vs. Lemmatization**  \n",
    "### **What is Stemming?**  \n",
    "Stemming reduces words to their root **without considering meaning**. It is a **rule-based** method that often results in incorrect words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Stemming with Porter Stemmer**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n",
    "words = [\"running\", \"flies\", \"studying\"]\n",
    "stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(stemmed_words)  # ['run', 'fli', 'studi']\n",
    "```\n",
    "ðŸš¨ **Problem:** \"flies\" â†’ \"fli\" and \"studying\" â†’ \"studi\" are incorrect reductions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Lemmatization?**  \n",
    "Lemmatization **converts words to their dictionary base form** while considering meaning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Lemmatization**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n",
    "\n",
    "lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n",
    "words = [\"running\", \"flies\", \"better\"]\n",
    "lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos=\"v\") for word in words]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(lemmatized_words)  # ['run', 'fly', 'better']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Relevance:**  \n",
    "âœ… **Customer Support Chatbots**: Lemmatization ensures better query matching.  \n",
    "âœ… **Financial Report Analysis**: Improves accuracy when processing large text datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Text Normalization**  \n",
    "Text normalization ensures consistency in textual data by:  \n",
    "- Converting text to **lowercase** (\"NLP\" â†’ \"nlp\").  \n",
    "- Removing **punctuation and special characters** (\"hello!!!\" â†’ \"hello\").  \n",
    "- Handling **misspellings** (\"tommorow\" â†’ \"tomorrow\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Text Normalization**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "def normalize_text(text):\n",
    "    text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase\n",
    "    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text)  # Remove punctuation\n",
    "    return text\n",

    "normalized_text = normalize_text(sample_text)\n",
    "print(normalized_text)  # 'hello hows nlp today'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Relevance:**  \n",
    "âœ… **Spam Detection**: Ensures uniformity in email filtering.  \n",
    "âœ… **Product Review Analysis**: Reduces inconsistencies in sentiment classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Text Vectorization (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Embeddings)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Text Vectorization?**  \n",
    "Machines cannot process raw text directly, so it must be **converted into numerical representations**. Common vectorization techniques include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bag of Words (BoW)**  \n",
    "Represents text as a **word frequency matrix**, ignoring word order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Bag of Words**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",

    "# ['ai' 'fun' 'is' 'love' 'nlp']\n",
    "print(X.toarray())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸš¨ **Limitation:** BoW ignores word **meaning and context**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**  \n",
    "Gives higher importance to **rare words** and lower importance to **common words**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: TF-IDF**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()\n",

    "\n",
    "print(tfidf.get_feature_names_out())\n",
    "print(X_tfidf.toarray())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**  \n",
    "More advanced than BoW & TF-IDF, word embeddings capture **semantic meaning** in dense numerical vectors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Word2Vec**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from gensim.models import Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "sentences = [[\"I\", \"love\", \"NLP\"], [\"NLP\", \"is\", \"fun\"]]\n",
